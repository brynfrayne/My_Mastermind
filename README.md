<h1>Mastermind</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Mastermind is a classic code-breaking game. The objective is to guess the code that has been randomly generated by the computer in a limited number of attempts.

This repository contains two versions of the game: one written in Java and one written in C. Both versions have a similar gameplay but differ in their implementation.
